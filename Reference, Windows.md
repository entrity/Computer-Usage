## Windows VM

Get a Windows VM image from Microsoft at https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/

It will expire at some near date (see the page for details), so load it up in VirtualBox, then save a snapshot. Then just load from the snapshot in order to bypass the expiration check.
